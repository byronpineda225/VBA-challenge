Byron's VBA Scripting work

A VBA script was created that loops through all stock worksheets by year and generates key information 
relating to ticker, yearly change, percentage change, and total stock volume.

The yearly change is measured as the change from the stock's opening price at the beginning of a given year 
to the closing price at the end of that year.

The percentage change is the differential from the opening price at the beginning of a given year to its 
closing price at the end of that year.

Also the total volume of the stock is measured by ticker for a given year.

The yearly change is colored to indicate losses, gains, or zero changes. A green Yearly Change cell 
indicates a positive change; a red Yearly Change cell indicates a negative change; and a yellow Yearly Change
indicates a zero change.

As part of the Bonus section the VBA script will run on all worksheets, every year, just by running the 
script once.  A message box pops up after completion indicating that all worksheets have been processed.

Just as important credit is due to the coding logic/methods borrowed from VBA Session 3 class activities 
notably #6 and #7 and used for this homework.  Those provided us with logic we could implement
for checking the next row against current row and processing a batch of worksheets amongst other many 
other concepts such as the importance of commenting on your code.

And finally credit goes to our study group that collaborated on this challenging assignment.
