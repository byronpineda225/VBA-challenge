Byron's VBA Scripting work

 A VBA script was created that loops through all stock worksheets by year and
 generates key information relating to ticker, yearly change, percentage
 change, and total stock volume. In addition, Bonus items were implemented
 for obtaining greatest total volume by ticker; greatest percentage increase;
 and greatest percentage decrease.

 The yearly change is measured as the change from the stock's opening
 price at the beginning of a given year to the closing price at the end of
 that year.

 The percentage change is the differential from the opening price at the
 beginning of a given year to its closing price at the end of that year.

 Also the total volume of the stock is measured by ticker for a given year.

 The yearly change is colored to indicate losses, gains, or zero changes.
 A green Yearly Change cell indicates a positive change; a red Yearly
 Change cell indicates a negative change; and a yellow Yearly Change
 indicates a zero change.

 All of the Bonus section was completed successfully.  The greatest percentage
 increase/decrease and the greated total volume were added to the secondary
 summary table.  As stated earlier, the VBA script will run on all worksheets, every
 year, just by running the script once.  A message box pops up after completion
 indicating that all worksheets have been processed to alert the user.

 I need to pay credit for VBA Session 3 class activities notably #6 and #7 that
 played a key role in allowing this homework to be successfully completed. Those
 activities provided basic code and structures that were  implemented for this homework.
 Those were carefully curated enabling such key concepts as checking the next row
 against the current row and processing a batch of worksheets with one run command.
 Those takeaways saved countless hours!  In addition those activities showed the importance
 of commenting of code and making it easier to follow the logic.

 Finally credit must be given to our study group that collaborated on concepts for this
 challenging assignment.
